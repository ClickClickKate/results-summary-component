## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This is my first challenge using flexbox. I learned how to center it vertically on the page, which actually stumped me for a bit.

I 'mostly' learnt how to do gradients as well. Although I did use a gradient generator.

### Continued development

I really need to work to see if it is possible to use a CSS Varible in a place that uses an alpha. I could just not get that to work and assume it has to be the straight numbers of the RGB/HSL to then add the alpha in a RGBA/HSLA, rather then being about to use a var, then add alpha afterwards. I am actually thinking that it would be better to just set the RGBA as a global value and just reference it rather then mixing two modes together.
